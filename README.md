WMP-Metadata-Cleaner
=================================
This script is used to recursively remove all Windows Media Center metadata and album art cache files from if they have been unintentionally backed up to a non-Windows machine alongside music files.

## **Notes**
Make sure your backup/syncronization software is set to ignore the following files so they don't come back after running the script:
*  1
*  2
*  3
*  4
